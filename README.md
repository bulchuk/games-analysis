Analysis of the success patterns of games and platforms

We work in an online store that sells computer games worldwide. Historical game sales data, user and critics scores, genres and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) are available from public sources. Through analysis, we need to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

Our goal - perform data pre-processing, conduct exploratory analysis to identify patterns of game success, create a user profile for each region and perform hypothesis testing.
