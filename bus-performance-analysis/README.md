## Conclusion

I have conducted an analysis of users and acquistion channels an entertainment mobile app. I have determined the channel with the highest ad costs and CAC, while users from this channel are at a stable retention rate, and the conversion is low.  
Additionally I found the channel that brings the highest proportion of paying users, but at the same time, shows the lowest retention rate.
Based on the analysis I could give a recommendation to marketing department. Also it is recommended to conduct a cohort analysis on the cross section of channels and regions, because some channels may give high conversion only in one particular region, and their performance may be reduced at the expense of other regions.
