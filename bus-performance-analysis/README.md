## Task

Analyze the sales funnel and evaluate the results of A/A/B testing based on data from the use of a mobile application for selling food products.

## Libraries and Skills
*A/B-tests, python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, event analytics, product metrics, plotly, testing of statistical hypotheses, data visualization*

## Conclusion

In this project I studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, explored the path of users to purchase.
I have analyzed the results of an A/B-test for introducing new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group. It is revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior.
