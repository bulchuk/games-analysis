# Project - Analysis of the user behavior of the mobile application


## Data

We need to understand how users of a mobile application for selling products behave using the next data:

EventName — name of the event;

DeviceIDHash — unique user id;

EventTimestamp — time event;

ExpId — number of experiment: 246 and 247 — control groups, and 248 — experimental.

## Task

We need to study how and how many users make a purchase, as well as how many users get stuck on previous steps and on which ones.

Additionally, we need to investigate the results of the A/A/B experiment, as the designers wanted to change the fonts throughout the application, and the managers believe that it will be unusual for users. The decision will be made based on the results of the A/A/B test.

## Libraries
*pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, datetime, statsmodels, plotly*
